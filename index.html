    <h2><u>My Response To The Jack And The Beanstalk Pantomime</u></h2>

    <p>To Be Honest, i wasn't very excited for the Pantomime at first, the reason for this was that
        the performance was based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk">Jack And The Beanstalk</a> but why was this the reason? Well, considering
        Jack and the Beanstalk is classed as i children's tale, I thought that it was going to be the 
        old, straightforward, predictable story that has been told to many children.
    </p>
       
    <p>When the show started, I was(just like I mentioned before)very bored. The point in which my attidude
        changed was when they started to twist the story. The way this was done was by making it so a golden 
        egg fell from the sky rather than Jack climbing to the top and getting the hen which lays golden eggs.
    </p>

    <p>Overall, the Pantomime was one of a kind if you count the differences and amount twists. The logical 
        reason for this is how if you take another performance you will notice how it runs with either their
        own story or the exact same story as a famous children's tale with 1 or 2 twists.

    <p>So to conclude my Response, i would like to say that it was a delightful experience watching the
        Pantomime and it was truly excellent.</p>
